# CHAPTER 2 – INTRODUCTION TO ARDUINO
In Chapter 2 we will begin working with our Arduinos. This will include beginning to learn the basics of programming. We will cover an overview of the Arduino programming interface, basic program structure, how to use a prototyping board to build temporary circuits, and write our first programs.

## Work through the following:
1. Introduction to Arduino IDE
2. [Blink – Introduction to Arduino](blink.md)
3. [Breadboard – Introduction to Arduino](breadboard.md)
## Chapter 2 Assignments:
- Assignment 2.1 – Attach at least 5 LEDs to your Arduino, each to a separate pin. Light them up one after another in sequence. As one LED turns off the next should turn on. There should always be one LED lit at all times. Submit in Schoology
- Assignment 2.2 – Attach at least 5 LEDs to your Arduino, each to a separate pin. Flash them all together. All on and then all off simultaneously. Submit in Schoology
## When you are done you should be able to:
- Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE
- Wire your Arduino to a breadboard with LEDs and appropriate resistors
- Explain void setup() vs void loop()
- Explain the functions: pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay()
