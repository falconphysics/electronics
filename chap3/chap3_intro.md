# CHAPTER 3 – CONTROLLING THE FLOW
In Chapter 3 the focus will be on controlling to flow of a program. We will cover three different ways to leverage the power of computers to handle repetition. The net result will be three different ways to do the same task. In programming you will often find there are multiple ways to accomplish any task.

Work through the following:
1. [Sequence LEDs with If](sequence_if.md)
2. [Sequence LEDs with While](sequence_while.md)
3. [Sequence LEDs with For](sequence_for.md)
## Chapter 3 Challenge:
Write a program that uses IF, WHILE, or FOR to sequence multiple LEDs simultaneously. Such as, “Light LEDs at both ends and have them move to the center.
