# CHAPTER 4 – DIGITAL INPUT AND SERIAL COMMUNICATION
So far the interaction with with our Arduino has been one way. The Arduino can turn on or off LEDs to tell us things, but so far we can’t interact directly with the program as it is running on the board. In this chapter we will change that by adding push buttons. We will also give our Arduino a new way to give us feedback.

### Work through the following:
1. Introduction to Serial Communication
2. Digital Input Tutorial
3. Alternating Action Switch
4. Assignment – Create an Interesting Push Button
